  abstract = {Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic, disabling anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent obsessive thoughts and uncontrolled repetitive acts. Although many patients respond to various pharmacological treatments, there is a cohort of patients with intractable or refractory disease. The authors present the case of a patient with intractable OCD who was treated with bilateral electrical stimulators, which were stereotactically placed in the anterior limbs of the internal capsules. Following psychiatric consultation and 10 years of empirical medication regimens for OCD, a woman was referred for neurosurgical evaluation. After informed consent had been obtained from the patient, the authors placed bilateral stimulator leads in the anterior limbs of the internal capsules. The stereotactic coordinates were based on data in pertinent current literature. The stimulation parameters, which are presented in this paper, were set at 2 weeks and reviewed at 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively. No changes were required. Postoperative analysis included evaluation by the patient's referring psychiatrist, a second independent psychiatrist, and pre- and postoperative administration of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. A marked improvement was noted in thispatient's OCD symptomatology and general psychosocial function. Previous documentation of patient responses to psychosurgical procedures for intractable or refractory OCD has been met with little enthusiasm, presumably because of the invasiveness and irreversibility of the surgery. In this report the authors suggest that deep brain stimulation of appropriate targets may be an effective and safe treatment for certain patients with OCD and a potentially reversible treatment for those patients who do not obtain therapeutic benefit.},

  abstract = {Over the past 15 years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been actively investigated as a groundbreaking therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD); nevertheless, outcomes have varied from patient to patient, with an average response rate of ∼50\%. The engagement of specific fiber tracts at the stimulation site has been hypothesized to be an important factor in determining outcomes, however, the resulting individual network effects at the whole-brain scale remain largely unknown. Here we provide a computational framework that can explore each individual's brain response characteristics elicited by selective stimulation of fiber tracts. We use a novel personalized in-silico approach, the Virtual Big Brain, which makes use of high-resolution virtual brain models at a mm-scale and explicitly reconstructs more than 100,000 fiber tracts for each individual. Each fiber tract is active and can be selectively stimulated. Simulation results demonstrate distinct stimulus-induced event-related potentials as a function of stimulation location, parametrized by the contact positions of the electrodes implanted in each patient, even though validation against empirical patient data reveals some limitations (i.e., the need for individual parameter adjustment, and differential accuracy across stimulation locations). This study provides evidence for the capacity of personalized high-resolution virtual brain models to investigate individual network effects in DBS for patients with TRD and opens up novel avenues in the personalized optimization of brain stimulation.},

This review mainly covers artificial-intelligence approaches to RL, from the viewpoint of the control engineer. We explain how approximate representations of the solution make RL feasible for problems with continuous states and control actions. Stability is a central concern in control, and we argue that while the control-theoretic RL subfield called adaptive dynamic programming is dedicated to it, stability of RL largely remains an open question. We also cover in detail the case where deep neural networks are used for approximation, leading to the field of deep RL, which has shown great success in recent years. With the control practitioner in mind, we outline opportunities and pitfalls of deep RL; and we close the survey with an outlook that – among other things – points out some avenues for bridging the gap between control and artificial-intelligence RL techniques.},

We formulate such a networked MARL (NMARL) problem as a spatiotemporal Markov decision process and introduce a spatial discount factor to stabilize the training of each local agent. Further, we propose a new differentiable communication protocol, called NeurComm, to reduce information loss and non-stationarity in NMARL. Based on experiments in realistic NMARL scenarios of adaptive traffic signal control and cooperative adaptive cruise control, an appropriate spatial discount factor effectively enhances the learning curves of non-communicative MARL algorithms, while NeurComm outperforms existing communication protocols in both learning efficiency and control performance.},

It aims at simulations of large neural systems with more than 10(4) neurons and 10(7) to 10(9) synapses. NEST is implemented in C++ and can be used on a large range of architectures from single-core laptops over multi-core desktop computers to super-computers with thousands of processor cores. Python (http://www.python.org) is a modern programming language that has recently received considerable attention in Computational Neuroscience. Python is easy to learn and has many extension modules for scientific computing (e.g. http://www.scipy.org). In this contribution we describe PyNEST, the new user interface to NEST. PyNEST combines NEST's efficient simulation kernel with the simplicity and flexibility of Python. Compared to NEST's native simulation language SLI, PyNEST makes it easier to set up simulations, generate stimuli, and analyze simulation results. We describe how PyNEST connects NEST and Python and how it is implemented. With a number of examples, we illustrate how it is used.},

An emerging perspective characterizes obsessive–compulsive behaviors as maladaptive habit learning3,4, which may be associated with abnormal beta–gamma neurophysiology of the orbitofrontal–striatal circuitry during reward processing5,6. We target the orbitofrontal cortex with alternating current, personalized to the intrinsic beta–gamma frequency of the reward network, and show rapid, reversible, frequency-specific modulation of reward- but not punishment-guided choice behavior and learning, driven by increased exploration in the setting of an actor-critic architecture. Next, we demonstrate that chronic application of the procedure over 5\,days robustly attenuates obsessive–compulsive behavior in a non-clinical population for 3\,months, with the largest benefits for individuals with more severe symptoms. Finally, we show that convergent mechanisms underlie modulation of reward learning and reduction of obsessive–compulsive symptoms. The results contribute to neurophysiological theories of reward, learning and obsessive–compulsive behavior, suggest a unifying functional role of rhythms in the beta–gamma range, and set the groundwork for the development of personalized circuit-based therapeutics for related disorders.},

In this technical note, we propose a probabilistic framework, namely the Bayesian Virtual Epileptic Patient (BVEP), which relies on the fusion of structural data of individuals to infer the spatial map of epileptogenicity in a personalized large-scale brain model of epilepsy spread. To invert the individualized whole-brain model employed in this study, we use the recently developed algorithms known as No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) as well as Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI). Our results indicate that NUTS and ADVI accurately estimate the degree of epileptogenicity of brain regions, therefore, the hypothetical brain areas responsible for the seizure initiation and propagation, while the convergence diagnostics and posterior behavior analysis validate the reliability of the estimations. Moreover, we illustrate the efficiency of the transformed non-centered parameters in comparison to centered form of parameterization. The Bayesian framework used in this work proposes an appropriate patient-specific strategy for estimating the epileptogenicity of the brain regions to improve outcome after epilepsy surgery.},

Current transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technology is limited to stimulating a single brain area once in a given trial. Here, we present a feasibility study for a novel TMS system based on multi-channel reconfigurable coils. With this hardware, researchers will be able to stimulate multiple brain sites in any temporal order in a trial. The system employs a wire-mesh coil, constructed using x- and y-directional wires. By varying the current direction and/or strength on each wire, we can configure the proposed mesh-wire coil into a standard loop coil and figure-eight coil of varying size. This provides maximum flexibility to the experimenter in that the location and extent of stimulation on the brain surface can be modified depending on experimental requirement. Moreover, one can dynamically and automatically modify the site(s) of stimulation several times within the span of seconds. By pre-storing various sequences of excitation patterns inside a control unit, one can explore the effect of dynamic TMS on behavior, in associative learning, and as rehabilitative therapy. Here, we present a computer simulation and bench experiments that show the feasibility of the dynamically-reconfigurable coil.},

Resting state dynamics increasingly play a role in the assessment of connectivity-based pathologies such as Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. We systematically applied tDCS in a large-scale network model of 74 cerebral areas, investigating the spatiotemporal changes in dynamic states as a function of structural connectivity changes. Structural connectivity was defined by the human connectome. The main findings of this study are fourfold: Firstly, we found a tDCS-induced increase in functional connectivity among cerebral areas and among EEG sensors, where the latter reproduced empirical findings of other researchers. Secondly, the analysis of the network dynamics suggested synchronization to be the main mechanism of the observed effects. Thirdly, we found that tDCS sharpens and shifts the frequency distribution of scalp EEG sensors slightly towards higher frequencies. Fourthly, new dynamic states emerged through interacting areas in the network compared to the dynamics of an isolated area. The findings propose synchronization as a key mechanism underlying the changes in the spatiotemporal pattern formation due to tDCS. Our work supports the notion that noninvasive brain stimulation is able to bias brain dynamics by affecting the competitive interplay of functional subnetworks.},

Currently, the DBS is in an open-loop pattern with which the stimulation parameters remain constant regardless of fluctuations in the disease state, and adjustments of parameters rely mostly on trial and error of experienced clinicians. This could bring adverse effects to patients due to possible overstimulation. Thus closed-loop DBS of which stimulation parameters are automatically adjusted based on variations in the ongoing neurophysiological signals is desired. In this paper, we present a closed-loop DBS method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to regulate stimulation parameters based on a computational model. The network model consists of interconnected biophysically-based spiking neurons, and the PD state is described as distorted relay reliability of thalamus (TH). Results show that the RL-based closed-loop control strategy can effectively restore the distorted relay reliability of the TH but with less DBS energy expenditure.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been successfully applied in various neurodegenerative diseases as an effective symptomatic treatment. However, its mechanisms of action within the brain network are still poorly understood. Many virtual DBS models analyze a subnetwork around the basal ganglia and its dynamics as a spiking network with their details validated by experimental data. However, connectomic evidence shows widespread effects of DBS affecting many different cortical and subcortical areas. From a clinical perspective, various effects of DBS besides the motoric impact have been demonstrated. The neuroinformatics platform The Virtual Brain (TVB) offers a modeling framework allowing us to virtually perform stimulation, including DBS, and forecast the outcome from a dynamic systems perspective prior to invasive surgery with DBS lead placement. For an accurate prediction of the effects of DBS, we implement a detailed spiking model of the basal ganglia, which we combine with TVB via our previously developed co-simulation environment. This multiscale co-simulation approach builds on the extensive previous literature of spiking models of the basal ganglia while simultaneously offering a whole-brain perspective on widespread effects of the stimulation going beyond the motor circuit. In the first demonstration of our model, we show that virtual DBS can move the firing rates of a Parkinson’s disease patient’s thalamus - basal ganglia network towards the healthy regime while, at the same time, altering the activity in distributed cortical regions with a pronounced effect in frontal regions. Thus, we provide proof of concept for virtual DBS in a co-simulation environment with TVB. The developed modeling approach has the potential to optimize DBS lead placement and configuration and forecast the success of DBS treatment for individual patients. Highlights- We implement and validate a co-simulation approach of a spiking network model for subcortical regions in and around the basal ganglia and interface it with mean-field network models for each cortical region.- Our simulations are based on a normative connectome including detailed tracts between the cortex and the basal ganglia regions combined with subject-specific optimized weights for a healthy control and a patient with Parkinson’s disease.- We provide proof of concept by demonstrating that the implemented model shows biologically plausible dynamics during resting state including decreased thalamic activity in the virtual patient and during virtual deep brain stimulation including normalized thalamic activity and distributed altered cortical activity predominantly in frontal regions.- The presented co-simulation model can be used to tailor deep brain stimulation for individual patients.},

The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.}

  abstract = {Brain function is thought to emerge from the interactions among neuronal populations. Apart from traditional efforts to reproduce brain dynamics from the micro- to macroscopic scales, complementary approaches develop phenomenological models of lower complexity. Such macroscopic models typically generate only a few selected-ideally functionally relevant-aspects of the brain dynamics. Importantly, they often allow an understanding of the underlying mechanisms beyond computational reproduction. Adding detail to these models will widen their ability to reproduce a broader range of dynamic features of the brain. For instance, such models allow for the exploration of consequences of focal and distributed pathological changes in the system, enabling us to identify and develop approaches to counteract those unfavorable processes. Toward this end, The Virtual Brain (TVB) ( www.thevirtualbrain.org ), a neuroinformatics platform with a brain simulator that incorporates a range of neuronal models and dynamics at its core, has been developed. This integrated framework allows the model-based simulation, analysis, and inference of neurophysiological mechanisms over several brain scales that underlie the generation of macroscopic neuroimaging signals. In this article, we describe how TVB works, and we present the first proof of concept.},

  abstract = {The brain is a complex, plastic, electrical network whose dysfunctions result in neurological disorders. Multichannel transcranial electrical stimulation (tCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique with the potential for network-oriented therapy. Challenges to realizing this vision include the proper identification of involved networks in a patient-specific context, a deeper understanding of the effects of stimulation on interconnected neuronal populations - both immediate and plastic - and, based on these, developing strategies to personalize brain stimulation interventions. For this reason, personalized hybrid biophysical and physiological models of brain networks are poised to play a key role in the evolution of network-oriented transcranial stimulation. We review some of the recent work in this emerging area of research and provide an outlook for future modeling and experimental work, as well as for developing its clinical applications in fields such as epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Objective: To report long-term efficacy and safety results of the SANTE trial investigating deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) for treatment of localization-related epilepsy. Methods: This long-term follow-up is a continuation of a previously reported trial of 5- vs 0-V ANT stimulation. Long-term follow-up began 13 months after device implantation with stimulation parameters adjusted at the investigators' discretion. Seizure frequency was determined using daily seizure diaries. Results: The median percent seizure reduction from baseline at 1 year was 41\%, and 69\% at 5 years. The responder rate (≥50\% reduction in seizure frequency) at 1 year was 43\%, and 68\% at 5 years. In the 5 years of follow-up, 16\% of subjects were seizure-free for at least 6 months. There were no reported unanticipated adverse device effects or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages. The Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale and 31-item Quality of Life in Epilepsy measure showed statistically significant improvement over baseline by 1 year and at 5 years (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: Long-term follow-up of ANT deep brain stimulation showed sustained efficacy and safety in a treatment-resistant population. Classification of evidence: This long-term follow-up provides Class IV evidence that for patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy, anterior thalamic stimulation is associated with a 69\% reduction in seizure frequency and a 34\% serious device-related adverse event rate at 5 years.},

  abstract = {Introduction: While the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases, our knowledge on the underlying mechanisms, outcome predictors, or therapeutic targets is limited. In this work, we demonstrate how computational multi-scale brain modeling links phenomena of different scales and therefore identifies potential disease mechanisms leading the way to improved diagnostics and treatment. Methods: The Virtual Brain (TVB; thevirtualbrain.org) neuroinformatics platform allows standardized large-scale structural connectivity-based simulations of whole brain dynamics. We provide proof of concept for a novel approach that quantitatively links the effects of altered molecular pathways onto neuronal population dynamics. As a novelty, we connect chemical compounds measured with positron emission tomography (PET) with neural function in TVB addressing the phenomenon of hyperexcitability in AD related to the protein amyloid beta (Abeta). We construct personalized virtual brains based on an averaged healthy connectome and individual PET derived distributions of Abeta in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 8) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD, N = 10) and in age-matched healthy controls (HC, N = 15) using data from ADNI-3 data base (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). In the personalized virtual brains, individual Abeta burden modulates regional Excitation-Inhibition balance, leading to local hyperexcitation with high Abeta loads. We analyze simulated regional neural activity and electroencephalograms (EEG). Results: Known empirical alterations of EEG in patients with AD compared to HCs were reproduced by simulations. The virtual AD group showed slower frequencies in simulated local field potentials and EEG compared to MCI and HC groups. The heterogeneity of the Abeta load is crucial for the virtual EEG slowing which is absent for control models with homogeneous Abeta distributions. Slowing phenomena primarily affect the network hubs, independent of the spatial distribution of Abeta. Modeling the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism of memantine in local population models, reveals potential functional reversibility of the observed large-scale alterations (reflected by EEG slowing) in virtual AD brains. Discussion: We demonstrate how TVB enables the simulation of systems effects caused by pathogenetic molecular candidate mechanisms in human virtual brains.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) with a single electrical source is effective for motor symptom relief in patients with Parkinson's disease. We postulated that a multiple-source, constant-current device that permits well defined distribution of current would lead to motor improvement in patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre, non-randomised, open-label intervention study of an implantable DBS device (the VANTAGE study) at six specialist DBS centres at universities in six European countries. Patients were judged eligible if they were aged 21-75 years, had been diagnosed with bilateral idiopathic Parkinson's disease with motor symptoms for more than 5 years, had a Hoehn and Yahr score of 2 or greater, and had a Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale part III (UPDRS III) score in the medication-off state of more than 30, which improved by 33\% or more after a levodopa challenge. Participants underwent bilateral implantation in the subthalamic nucleus of a multiple-source, constant-current, eight-contact, rechargeable DBS system, and were assessed 12, 26, and 52 weeks after implantation. The primary endpoint was the mean change in UPDRS III scores (assessed by site investigators who were aware of the treatment assignment) from baseline (medication-off state) to 26 weeks after first lead implantation (stimulation-on, medication-off state). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01221948. FINDINGS: Of 53 patients enrolled in the study, 40 received a bilateral implant in the subthalamic nucleus and their data contributed to the primary endpoint analysis. Improvement was noted in the UPDRS III motor score 6 months after first lead implantation (mean 13·5 [SD 6·8], 95\% CI 11·3-15·7) compared with baseline (37·4 [8·9], 34·5-40·2), with a mean difference of 23·8 (SD 10·6; 95\% CI 20·3-27·3; p{$<$}0·0001). One patient died of pneumonia 24 weeks after implantation, which was judged to be unrelated to the procedure. 125 adverse events were reported, the most frequent of which were dystonia, speech disorder, and apathy. 18 serious adverse events were recorded, three of which were attributed to the device or procedure (one case each of infection, migration, and respiratory depression). All serious adverse events resolved without residual effects and stimulation remained on during the study. INTERPRETATION: The multiple-source, constant-current, eight-contact DBS system suppressed motor symptoms effectively in patients with Parkinson's disease, with an acceptable safety profile. Future trials are needed to investigate systematically the potential benefits of this system on postoperative outcome and its side-effects. FUNDING: Boston Scientific.},

The interface in Python has been designed to be close to the PyNN interface, while the definition of neuron and synapse models can be specified using an equation-oriented mathematical description similar to the Brian neural simulator. This information is used to generate C++ code that will efficiently perform the simulation on the chosen parallel hardware (multi-core system or graphical processing unit). Several numerical methods are available to transform ordinary differential equations into an efficient C++code. We compare the parallel performance of the simulator to existing solutions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus is an established therapeutic option for managing motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. We conducted a double-blind, sham-controlled, randomised controlled trial to assess subthalamic nucleus DBS, with a novel multiple independent contact current-controlled (MICC) device, in patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: This trial took place at 23 implanting centres in the USA. Key inclusion criteria were age between 22 and 75 years, a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease with over 5 years of motor symptoms, and stable use of anti-parkinsonian medications for 28 days before consent. Patients who passed screening criteria were implanted with the DBS device bilaterally in the subthalamic nucleus. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either active therapeutic stimulation settings (active group) or subtherapeutic stimulation settings (control group) for the 3-month blinded period. Randomisation took place with a computer-generated data capture system using a pre-generated randomisation table, stratified by site with random permuted blocks. During the 3-month blinded period, both patients and the assessors were masked to the treatment group while the unmasked programmer was responsible for programming and optimisation of device settings. The primary outcome was the difference in mean change from baseline visit to 3 months post-randomisation between the active and control groups in the mean number of waking hours per day with good symptom control and no troublesome dyskinesias, with no increase in anti-parkinsonian medications. Upon completion of the blinded phase, all patients received active treatment in the open-label period for up to 5 years. Primary and secondary outcomes were analysed by intention to treat. All patients who provided informed consent were included in the safety analysis. The open-label phase is ongoing with no new enrolment, and current findings are based on the prespecified interim analysis of the first 160 randomly assigned patients. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01839396. FINDINGS: Between May 17, 2013, and Nov 30, 2017, 313 patients were enrolled across 23 sites. Of these 313 patients, 196 (63\%) received the DBS implant and 191 (61\%) were randomly assigned. Of the 160 patients included in the interim analysis, 121 (76\%) were randomly assigned to the active group and 39 (24\%) to the control group. The difference in mean change from the baseline visit (post-implant) to 3 months post-randomisation in increased ON time without troublesome dyskinesias between the active and control groups was 3·03 h (SD 4·52, 95\% CI 1·3-4·7; p{$<$}0·0001). 26 serious adverse events in 20 (13\%) patients occurred during the 3-month blinded period. Of these, 18 events were reported in the active group and 8 in the control group. One death was reported among the 196 patients before randomisation, which was unrelated to the procedure, device, or stimulation. INTERPRETATION: This double-blind, sham-controlled, randomised controlled trial provides class I evidence of the safety and clinical efficacy of subthalamic nucleus DBS with a novel MICC device for the treatment of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Future trials are needed to investigate potential benefits of producing a more defined current field using MICC technology, and its effect on clinical outcomes. FUNDING: Boston Scientific.},

This paper presents and proves in detail a convergence theorem for \textasciitilde -learning based on that outlined in Watkins (1989). We show that 0\textasciitilde -learning converges to the optimum action-values with probability 1 so long as all actions are repeatedly sampled in all states and the action-values are represented discretely. We also sketch extensions to the cases of non-discounted, butabsorbing, Markov environments, and where many O \textasciitilde{} values can be changed each iteration, rather than just one.},

The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of waveform shape and duration on the charge, power, and energy efficiency of neural stimulation. Using a population model of mammalian axons and in vivo experiments on cat sciatic nerve, we analyzed the stimulation efficiency of four waveform shapes: square, rising exponential, decaying exponential, and rising ramp. No waveform was simultaneously energy-, charge-, and power-optimal, and differences in efficiency among waveform shapes varied with pulse width (PW). For short PWs ({$<$} or = 0.1 ms), square waveforms were no less energy-efficient than exponential waveforms, and the most charge-efficient shape was the ramp. For long PW s ({$>$} or = 0.5 ms), the square was the least energy-efficient and charge-efficient shape, but across most PW s, the square was the most power-efficient shape. Rising exponentials provided no practical gains in efficiency over the other shapes, and our results refute previous claims that the rising exponential is the energy-optimal shape. An improved understanding of how stimulation parameters affect stimulation efficiency will help improve the design and programming of implantable stimulators to minimize tissue damage and extend battery life.},

We used a genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the energy-optimal waveform shape for neural stimulation. The GA was coupled to a computational model of extracellular stimulation of a mammalian myelinated axon. As the GA progressed, waveforms became increasingly energy efficient and converged upon an energy-optimal shape. The results of the GA were consistent across several trials, and resulting waveforms resembled truncated Gaussian curves. When constrained to monophasic cathodic waveforms, the GA produced waveforms that were symmetric about the peak, which occurred approximately during the middle of the pulse. However, when the cathodic waveforms were coupled to rectangular charge-balancing anodic pulses, the location and sharpness of the peak varied with the duration and timing (i.e., before or after the cathodic phase) of the anodic phase. In a model of a population of mammalian axons and in vivo experiments on a cat sciatic nerve, the GA-optimized waveforms were more energy efficient and charge efficient than several conventional waveform shapes used in neural stimulation. If used in implantable neural stimulators, GA-optimized waveforms could prolong battery life, thereby reducing the frequency of recharge intervals, the volume of implanted pulse generators, and the costs and risks of battery-replacement surgeries.},
